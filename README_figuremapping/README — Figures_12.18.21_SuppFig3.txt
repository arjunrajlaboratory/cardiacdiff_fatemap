A. Venn diagram adapted with permission from Goyal et al. 2021.

B. Barcode coverage UMAPs were generated using the script plotScripts/barcodecoverage.R. Bar graphs denoting raw number and proportion of barcoded GFP positive cells per cluster were generated using the script plotScripts/proportionbarcodedpercluster.R. Split A UMAP can be found at plotData/Supplement/coverage/barcodesibA_umap.pdf. Split A bar graphs can be found at plotData/Supplement/barcodeclusterdistributionA_stack and plotData/Supplement/barcodeclusterdistributionA_perstack. Split B UMAP can be found at plotData/Supplement/coverage/barcodesibB_umap.pdf. Split A bar graphs can be found at plotData/Supplement/barcodeclusterdistributionB_stack and plotData/Supplement/barcodeclusterdistributionB_perstack.

C. Heatmaps demonstrating normalized gene expression for the top 15 markers for Seurat clusters 1 (orange), 3 (khaki), and 5 (green) were generated using the script plotSCripts/clusters135markers.R and can be found at plotData/Supplement/htlist_raster4.pdf.
