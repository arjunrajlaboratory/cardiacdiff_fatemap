A. Schematic created in Adobe Illustrator CC 2020. 

B. Observed and simulated venn diagrams between differentiated splits from MOI 0.5 condition generated from the annotated section of the script plotScripts/Figure3.R. Venn diagram constructed from simulated data can be found at plotData/Figure3/VD_gDNA/g1MOI0.5/simulation/splitA_splitBoverlap0.11.pdf. Venn data generated from observed data can be found at plotData/Figure3/VD_gDNA/g1MOI0.5/nocutoff/g1MOI0.5_VDdiffs.pdf.

C. All components generated from the annotated section of the script plotScripts/Figure3.R. The scatterplot showing the barcode distribution across splits of the top 100 barcodes associated with the most cells can be found at plotData/Figure3/top100plot.pdf. Pullout UMAPs for barcodes 2, 5, 7, and 20 can be found at plotData/Figure3/B2umap.pdf, plotData/Figure3/B5umap.pdf, plotData/Figure3/B7umap.pdf, and plotData/Figure3/B20umap.pdf, respectively.
